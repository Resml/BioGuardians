## üåä The Problem: Marine Biofouling

Marine biofouling is the undesirable accumulation of organisms on submerged surfaces, a significant challenge for the Indian Navy. This buildup increases drag on ships, leading to reduced speed, higher fuel consumption, and increased maintenance costs. It also poses a biosecurity risk by transporting invasive species. Manual inspection is slow, subjective, and requires specialized expertise, making it difficult to scale across a fleet.

## üí° Our Solution:

**BioFouling Detection** is an end-to-end deep learning framework that automates the analysis of biofouling. By leveraging **semantic segmentation**, our system moves beyond simple detection to provide a detailed, pixel-level map of fouled surfaces. This allows for precise species classification and accurate density measurement, delivering actionable intelligence for maintenance and operational planning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

Our application is structured as an end-to-end pipeline, from image acquisition to delivering operational outputs via a user-friendly dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automated Species Classification:** Uses a powerful U-Net model to identify various types of fouling like barnacles, tubeworms, bryozoans, and slime.

- **Accurate Density Estimation:** Calculates the precise percentage of surface area covered by each species, eliminating the guesswork of manual methods.

- **Novel Performance Metrics:** Generates advanced insights, such as identifying organisms in **direct contact with the hull**, a critical factor for evaluating antifouling coatings.

- **Scalable and Objective:** Provides a standardized, data-driven approach that can be deployed across the entire fleet for consistent and repeatable analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **AI/ML Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras

- **Model Architecture:** Adapted U-Net with a pre-trained EfficientNet B2 Encoder

- **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI) for the API and processing server

- **Frontend:** A modern web framework (e.g., React) for the user dashboard

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Upload Image:** A user uploads a high-resolution image of a fouled surface through the web interface.

2. **AI Analysis:** The image is sent to the processing server, where it is preprocessed and fed into the Foul-Seg segmentation model.

3. **Generate Report:** The model outputs a detailed segmentation map. The server calculates the density of each species and other key metrics.

4. **View Results:** The user receives a comprehensive report on the dashboard, including the annotated image and quantitative data visualizations.
